# Linux CLI Practice Lab  
This section documents my hands-on practice using the EC2 instance through the Command Line Interface (CLI).
## Command Reference  
- **pwd** – Displays the current directory I’m working in.  
- **ls** – Lists files and folders in the current directory.  
- **cd** – Navigates between directories.  
- **mkdir** – Creates a new directory.  
- **nano** – Opens a terminal-based text editor to create or modify files.  
- **cat** – Displays the contents of a file in the terminal.  
- **rm** – Removes a file from the system.  
## Practice Summary  
Using these commands, I created a file, wrote a custom message, verified its existence, and then safely deleted it.
This exercise strengthened my confidence in managing a Linux environment directly from the terminal.
