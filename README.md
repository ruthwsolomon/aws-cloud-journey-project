# AWS Cloud Journey Project
This repository documents my hands-on journey learning Amazon Web Services by building a real cloud architecture step by step.
## Project Roadmap
### Phase 1 – Static Website Hosting (S3) 
**Objective:** Deployed a globally accessible static website using Amazon S3 buckets. ([`See details`](phase1-static-website.md))

### Phase 2 – Web Server on EC2 
**Objective:** Deployed a Linux web server on AWS EC2 and managed it securely via Windows PowerShell and Instance Connect, ensuring 24/7 availability with optimized security configurations. (['See details'](phase2-main.md))

### Phase 3 – Database Integration
**Goal:** Connect a running application to a managed Relational Database Service (RDS).
### Phase 4 – Production Architecture
**Goal:** Implement high availability using Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, and CloudWatch monitoring.
