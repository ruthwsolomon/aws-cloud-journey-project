# Phase 2 – Web Server on EC2 Accomplishments

1. [Launching the Server (AWS EC2)](phase2-ec2-launch.md) - I created a live Linux instance on Amazon EC2, configuring the virtual hardware and networking to make the server accessible over the internet. 
2. [CLI-Practice](CLI-Practice.md) - I gained hands-on experience with the EC2 instance by practicing to navigate directories, managing file ownership, and using core Linux CLI tools, building comfort with working entirely in the terminal.
3. [Service Management](service-management.md) - I managed the Apache web server, monitoring its status, starting and stopping the service, and configuring it to automatically restart on server reboot.
4. [Connecting Windows to Linux and AWS SSH & Security](ssh-security.md)- I established a secure remote management pipeline by configuring Windows PowerShell to connect to an AWS EC2 Linux instance, where I manually generated RSA key pairs, hardened file permissions via `icacls`, and updated the server's authorized_keys to enforce strictly controlled, key-based access.
5. **Planned:** [Bash script to install Apache automatically](apache-bash-script.md) – to be completed.
